# 📊 Unemployment Analysis in India (2020)

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship with CodeAlpha**.
It focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India using Python, with a special emphasis on understanding the **impact of COVID-19 on employment levels**.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The project uses unemployment data from India (up to November 2020) to:

* Explore how unemployment rates varied across different regions.
* Identify patterns and seasonal trends.
* Analyze the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on employment.
* Present insights that can inform economic and social policies.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on publicly available datasets:

* **Unemployment in India.csv**
* **Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv**

Each dataset includes information such as:

* Region / Area
* Date
* Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
* Estimated Employed
* Labour Participation Rate (%)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical plots

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

   * Standardized column names and data types
   * Handled missing or inconsistent values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Regional unemployment comparison
   * Month-wise trend visualization
   * COVID-19 impact analysis

3. **Insights**

   * Noticeable spike in unemployment during March–May 2020 due to nationwide lockdown.
   * Certain regions experienced higher unemployment rates than others.
   * Gradual recovery observed post-lockdown months.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* Average unemployment rate by region
* Time-series plot showing unemployment trends over 2020
* Region-wise trend lines showing COVID-19 impact

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* The COVID-19 lockdown caused a sharp increase in unemployment rates in early 2020.
* Recovery varied by region, indicating the need for targeted economic interventions.
* Data-driven analysis like this can help policymakers plan for future employment challenges.
